<p align="center"> It was possible to classify the water class with RF and identification of floods in areas of interest, as per presents the Charter initiative map with media images spatial resolution (30 m) of the Landsat-8 satellite. In works future classification will be carried out with other algorithms pattern identification.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The flood events that occurred in 2014 in the municipality of Porto Velho, capital of the state of Rond√¥nia, were analyzed in this study using flood maps generated by the initiative The International Charter Space and Major Disasters. Charter's products show where events occurred and were used in this work to perform sampling for a pattern recognition algorithm. In this context, 4 class labels were made, namely water, soil, vegetation and urban, to highlight only the areas with water accumulation. Data was separated for training and testing in the Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm. The processing of images from the Landsat-8 satellite, OLI sensor, was carried out using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform, and aimed to analyze an image before the floods (August 2013), and another after the floods. (April 2014), in order to identify these targets. To verify the learning of the RF, images from 2013 and 2014 were classified, thus obtaining a difference between flooded areas and where the drainage network remained the same. When building the application in a GHG environment, it was chosen to visualize only the ‚Äúwater‚Äù class on the final map, before and after the events, aiming to highlight, in the application, only the places where there were floods. The application results show, on the left side of the sliding window, the classification of the ‚Äúwater‚Äù class of the image before the flood, in blue, and, on the right side, the classification of this class after the disaster. On the right side there is also the water classification (in white) from the image before the disaster, to highlight the flooded areas.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions provide a working copy of the project for development and testing purposes. See Development in: [GEE Platform Development](https://code.earthengine.google.com/ad5d5806bef01e3b783a30a155e7f839), [GEE Application](https://ee-cesarmoraes.projects.earthengine. app/view/classificacao-inundacoes -porto-velho-ro-2014-sliding-map). These are the project implementation notes.

## Prerequisites <a name = "prerequisites"></a>

To use GEE you need to open an account using gmail at:

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

The following code presents the metrics used to evaluate the RF according to the separate test samples:

```
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Classificar o conjunto de testes
var testClassified = testSet.classify(classifier);

// Calcular a matriz de confus√£o
var confusionMatrix = ee.ConfusionMatrix(testClassified
  .errorMatrix({
    actual: 'Class', // Nome da propriedade de classe real no conjunto de teste
    predicted: 'classification' // Nome da propriedade de classifica√ß√£o no resultado da classifica√ß√£o
  }));

// Calcular as m√©tricas de produtor e consumidor
var producerAccuracy = confusionMatrix.producersAccuracy(); // Produtor Accuracy
var consumerAccuracy = confusionMatrix.consumersAccuracy(); // Consumer Accuracy

print('Confusion Matrix:', confusionMatrix);
print('Overall Accuracy:', confusionMatrix.accuracy());
print('Producer Accuracy:', producerAccuracy);
print('Consumer Accuracy:', consumerAccuracy);
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The GEE App can be used to identify flooded areas, unlike image classification before the event.
